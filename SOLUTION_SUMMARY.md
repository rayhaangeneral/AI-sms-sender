# Solution Summary - Empty Message Issue Fixed

## üîç What Happened

You encountered multiple errors when trying to send SMS messages using OpenRouter with the model `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`:

1. **Initial Error**: "Message body is required" (from Twilio)
2. **After Fix**: "OpenRouter returned empty response" (caught before Twilio)
3. **Root Cause Found**: OpenRouter rate limit exceeded

### Root Cause
The AI model `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free` hit its **rate limit** on OpenRouter's free tier:
- ‚ùå "Global rate limit reached for this model due to high demand"
- ‚ùå "Your personal token limit was also reached"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Free models on OpenRouter are heavily rate-limited and often unavailable

### Why This Happened
1. **Free Model Limitations**: OpenRouter's free models have extremely strict rate limits
2. **High Demand**: Popular free models get exhausted quickly by all users
3. **Personal Limits**: Even if global limit isn't hit, personal limits are very low
4. **Initial Poor Error Handling**: The app wasn't catching these issues before sending to Twilio (now fixed)

```
Groq response: { choices: [{ message: { content: "" } }] }

```

```
Groq API error: { error: { message: "Rate limit exceeded" } }
Error: Groq API error: Rate limit exceeded
```

| "Rate limit exceeded" | Wait a few minutes or use different provider |
| "Invalid API key" | Check Settings, re-enter API key |
| "Message body is required" | Model returned empty - change model |
| Network error | Check internet connection |
