## üîß Alternative Solutions

### Option 2: Different OpenRouter Model

If you want to stay with OpenRouter, try a different free model:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Keep your OpenRouter API key
3. Go to **Home**
4. Change Model to one of these:
   - `google/gemini-flash-1.5` (best free option)
   - `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`
   - `qwen/qwen-2-7b-instruct:free`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** These may also hit rate limits. Groq is more reliable for free usage.

### Option 3: Add Credits to OpenRouter

1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai/credits
2. Add $5-10 credits
3. Use any model (paid models are very reliable):
   - `openai/gpt-4o-mini` (affordable, high quality)
   - `anthropic/claude-3-haiku` (great quality)
   - `google/gemini-pro-1.5` (good balance)

### Option 4: Wait and Retry

The free model may become available again:
- Wait 10-30 minutes
- Try sending again
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not reliable for production use

## üìä Why Groq is Better for Free Tier

| Feature | Groq | OpenRouter Free |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| **Rate Limits** | Very generous | Very strict ‚ùå |
| **Speed** | Extremely fast ‚ö° | Varies |
| **Reliability** | Consistent ‚úÖ | Often unavailable ‚ùå |
| **Quality** | High | Varies |
| **Setup** | Simple | Simple |
| **Cost** | Free | Free (but limited) |

**Bottom Line:** Groq is purpose-built for fast, free inference. OpenRouter free models are more for testing/exploration.

## üéì Your Python Code vs Browser Code

You mentioned this Python code works:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  api_key="sk-or-v1-...",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  extra_headers={
    "HTTP-Referer": "<YOUR_SITE_URL>",
    "X-Title": "<YOUR_SITE_NAME>",
  },
  extra_body={},
  model="openai/gpt-oss-20b:free",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain Quantization?"}]
)
```

**Why it worked in Python but not in browser:**

1. **Timing**: You ran it when the model had available capacity
2. **Rate Limits**: Each user/IP has separate limits; Python uses different IP
3. **Token Limits**: Your account's tokens got exhausted after that request
4. **Global Limits**: The model is now globally rate-limited

The model `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free` is:
- ‚ùå Not recommended for production
- ‚ùå Very strict limits (both personal and global)
- ‚ùå Often unavailable due to high demand
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Free" but unreliable
