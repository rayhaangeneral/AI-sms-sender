# 🔒 Critical Security Fix - API Key Isolation

## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: API Keys Shared Between Users (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** All users could see the same API keys from localStorage

**Root Cause:** 
- When a logged-in user had no data in Supabase, the code fell back to localStorage
- This caused new users to see API keys from other users who had used the app

**Fix:**
- When logged in, NEVER fall back to localStorage
- Return empty defaults for new users
- Only use localStorage when NOT logged in

### Issue 2: Custom Agents Not Loading
**Problem:** Agents were created but didn't load when selected in campaigns

**Root Causes:**
1. Same localStorage fallback issue - agents from other users could appear
2. Agents weren't properly isolated per user
3. Delete and save operations were contaminating localStorage

**Fixes:**
- Removed localStorage fallback for logged-in users
- Added proper error handling
- Added console logging for debugging
- Throw errors instead of silent fallbacks

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/utils/storage.js`**
   - `getApiKeys()` - No localStorage fallback when logged in
   - `getAgents()` - No localStorage fallback when logged in
   - `saveAgent()` - No localStorage fallback, throw errors
   - `deleteAgent()` - Only modify localStorage if NOT logged in

2. **`src/components/Home.jsx`**
   - Added console logging to debug agent loading
   - Better error messages
   - Alert user if agent fails to load

---

## 🧹 What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Clear Old Data (IMPORTANT!)

To prevent data contamination, you need to **clear localStorage**:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Click **Local Storage** → `http://localhost:5173`
4. Click **Clear All** or delete these keys:
   - `ai_sms_api_keys`
   - `ai_sms_agents`
   - `ai_sms_message_history`

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Start again
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test with Multiple Accounts

1. **Create Account 1:**
   - Sign up with email: `test1@example.com`
   - Log in
   - Go to Settings
   - Add API keys (unique to test1)
   - Save

2. **Create Account 2 (New Incognito Window):**
   - Open NEW incognito/private window
   - Go to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Sign up with email: `test2@example.com`
   - Log in
   - Go to Settings
   - **Check:** API keys should be EMPTY ✅
   - Add DIFFERENT API keys (unique to test2)
   - Save

3. **Verify Isolation:**
   - Go back to first window (test1)
   - Refresh page
   - **Check:** test1's API keys should still be there ✅
   - Go to second window (test2)
   - Refresh page
   - **Check:** test2's API keys should be different ✅

## 🔍 How to Verify Agents Work

### Test 1: Create Agent
1. Log in as test1
2. Go to **My Agents**
3. Click **Create New Agent**
4. Fill in:
   - Name: `Test Agent 1`
   - Provider: `groq`
   - Model: `llama3-8b-8192`
   - Message Prompt: `Send a test message`
   - Persona: Sales
5. Click **Save**
6. ✅ Check console logs: `Agent saved successfully to Supabase: [id]`

### Test 2: Load Agent in Campaign
1. Go to **Home** page
2. In **Load Agent Template** dropdown, select `Test Agent 1`
3. ✅ Check console logs:
   ```
   Loading agent: [id]
   Agent loaded: {...}
   Setting form data: {...}
   ```
4. ✅ Verify form fields are populated:
   - Provider: groq
   - Model: llama3-8b-8192
   - Message Prompt: Send a test message
   - Persona: Sales

### Test 3: Verify Agent Isolation
1. Log in as test2 (second incognito window)
2. Go to **My Agents**
3. ✅ **Check:** Should NOT see "Test Agent 1" ✅
4. Create a different agent: `Test Agent 2`
5. ✅ **Check:** test1 should NOT see "Test Agent 2" ✅

## 📊 Console Logs to Watch For

### Good Logs (Everything Working):
```
Loaded agents from Supabase: 3
Loading agent: 1234567890
Agent loaded: { id: '1234567890', name: 'Test Agent 1', ... }
Setting form data: { provider: 'groq', model: 'llama3-8b-8192', ... }
Agent saved successfully to Supabase: 1234567890
```

### Bad Logs (Something Wrong):
```
Error loading API keys from Supabase: {...}
No agents found in Supabase or error: {...}
Agent not found: 1234567890
Error saving agent to Supabase: {...}
```

## 🛡️ Security Improvements

### Before (Vulnerable):
- ❌ API keys shared between users
- ❌ Agents visible across accounts
- ❌ localStorage contamination
- ❌ Data leakage

### After (Secure):
- ✅ Complete user isolation
- ✅ User-specific API keys
- ✅ User-specific agents
- ✅ No localStorage fallback when logged in
- ✅ Proper error handling

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **LocalStorage Still Used:**
   - Only for users who are NOT logged in
   - This is intentional for offline/testing use
   - When you log in, Supabase takes over completely

2. **Data Migration:**
   - Old localStorage data is NOT automatically migrated
   - Users need to re-enter their API keys after logging in
   - This is intentional to prevent security issues

3. **Error Handling:**
   - If Supabase fails, operations will fail (no silent fallback)
   - Users will see error messages
   - Check browser console for details

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Cleared localStorage
- [ ] Restarted dev server
- [ ] Created test account 1
- [ ] Added API keys (account 1)
- [ ] Created test account 2 in incognito
- [ ] Verified API keys are separate
- [ ] Created agent (account 1)

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Copy any error messages**
3. **Check Supabase Logs:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
